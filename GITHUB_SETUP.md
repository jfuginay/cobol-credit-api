# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup Commands

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub.com**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: `cobol-credit-api`
   - Description: "Revolutionary COBOL-to-API Bridge - Making 50-year-old COBOL speak JSON"
   - Make it PUBLIC so others can see it
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Push your code** (copy and run these commands):

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cobol-credit-api.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

3. **Your shareable link will be:**
   - Repository: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cobol-credit-api`
   - Revolutionary doc: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cobol-credit-api/blob/main/REVOLUTIONARY.md`

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
# Create and push in one command
gh repo create cobol-credit-api --public --source=. --remote=origin --push --description="Revolutionary COBOL-to-API Bridge - Making 50-year-old COBOL speak JSON"
```

## After Pushing

Your REVOLUTIONARY.md will be viewable at:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cobol-credit-api/blob/main/REVOLUTIONARY.md`
